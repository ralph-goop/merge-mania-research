# Track 2 — Resource Economy

## Run Metadata

## Executive Snapshot
Completed synthesis for Merge Menagerie economy centers on three repeatability pillars:

- Energy loop as primary retention gate
- Exponential inventory expansion as a soft-currency sink
- Laddered monetization events that preserve value perception

## Key Findings

### Energy and Pacing
- Use a layered energy system rather than a single shared pool.
- Core loop target: around 100 max energy with moderate recharge (2–3 min) for healthy short-burst play.
- Event-specific energy can be slower-regenerating and isolated to keep event pacing independent.
- Laddered refill pricing (in premium currency) prevents binge abuse while preserving perceived fairness.

### Capacity Pressure and Currency Sinks
- Inventory slots are one of the strongest long-term soft sinks in merge games.
- Keep early growth forgiving, then scale cost nonlinearly to create meaningful spend points.
- Combine permanent slot expansion with temporary rental/rush options to avoid hard dead-ends.

### Inflation and Balance Controls
- Establish explicit sink-to-source ratio monitoring.
- Apply escalating costs for late-stage upgrades to avoid flat hoarding.
- Add event-specific sinks and prestige-like pressure when late-game soft currency growth outruns spend.

## Suggested Architecture for Merge Menagerie
1. Base economy: core currency (`coins`) for upgrades and slots.
2. Premium currency (`gems`) for convenience, skip, and occasional high-pressure relief.
3. Separate event economy channel for boards that use different pacing and sink logic.
4. Regular tuning cadence: track sink/source, inventory fullness, and energy-exhaustion rate.

## KPI Checklist (Launch-Ready)
- Sink-to-Source ratio: mid-game target 0.9x–1.1x
- Session-end energy exhaustion: target 60%+ of sessions
- Inventory fullness at >85%: target 40%–60% of active users
- Energy refill conversion rate per attempt by segment
