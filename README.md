# Merge Menagerie Research

## Project Overview
Merge Menagerie is a proposed merge-game deep-research project focused on turning game-loop insights into practical design and business decisions.

## Purpose
The repository documents evidence-backed research for all major systems:

- Merge progression architecture and pacing
- Resource economy and habitat/inventory scaling
- Event cadence and trigger design
- Retention and session architecture
- Competitive benchmarks
- Monetization and Game Design Document synthesis

## Methodology
- Research providers: `Perplexity` + `Parallel MCP`
- Execution model: dedicated deep-research runs (`trun_*`) for each topic
- Monitoring model: periodic status checks every ~30 seconds while runs are active
- Update model: publish completion updates and partial results whenever available
