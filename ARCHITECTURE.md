# Track 1 — Merge Progression Architecture

## Run Metadata
- Run ID: `trun_04740bf111ed4e89b66fff3d9721e0cd`
- Status (last checked): `running`
- Owner: Parallel MCP deep research run (Perplexity-backed)
- Target file for this track: `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Why this file exists
Track 1 documents the core progression architecture for Merge Menagerie, including merge graphs, board constraints, onboarding curve, and long-term depth loops.

## Current Snapshot
Research is still in progress. No final narrative is available yet, but the repository is now set up to receive the final structure.

## Placeholder Template (Pending Findings)
- Core progression spine:
  - Starter → bridge → mid-game convergence path
  - Merge tier structure and unlock dependencies
- Progress pacing model:
  - D1, D3, D7, D14 progression milestones
  - Session-length alignment with merge completion frequency
- Constraint systems:
  - Board size and merge bottlenecks
  - Inventory pressure and clutter avoidance
- Retention-ready hooks in progression:
  - Event-based temporary arcs
  - Daily/weekly rhythm with clear continuation points
- Recommended data points:
  - Drop-off points for merge chain depth
  - Typical merges per session
  - Time between tier transitions
- Risks:
  - Overly steep merge curves
  - Low late-game novelty and content drought
- Output format expectations:
  - Architecture diagram description in text and pseudo-notation
  - Numeric starter vs max progression targets
  - KPI checklist for launch and soft-launch tuning

## Next Data to Capture
- Final chain length per board stage
- Exact progression milestones with reward mapping
- Suggested difficulty formula for merge difficulty scaling
- Anti-friction transitions between board modes and event boards
