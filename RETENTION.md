# Retention (Additional Artifact Placeholder)

## Purpose
This file is an additional placeholder for retention-related notes that are not directly tied to the current named Track 4 document flow.

## Planned Contents
- Longitudinal retention cohort tables (D0/D1/D7/D30 by segment)
- Correlation matrix: session frequency, board fullness, push response
- Experiment log of retention interventions
- A/B test results for retention mechanics

## Status
No dedicated research run mapped to this file yet.

## Next Steps
Populate when additional retention analyses, field studies, or external benchmark runs are launched.
