# Track 3 — Event Trigger Design

## Run Metadata
- Run ID: `trun_04740bf111ed4e89a42f00b95c1c5703`
- Status: `running`
- Source: Parallel MCP deep research
- Last Checked: `running`

## Current Snapshot
Research is still running. Track-specific recommendations are not yet finalized.

## Placeholder Template (Pending Findings)
- Event calendar model:
  - Daily, weekly, and seasonal cadence
  - Event start/end trigger logic
- Trigger conditions:
  - State-based (board_full, session_end, energy_full)
  - Time-based (hourly/daily pulses)
- Event economy and economy isolation:
  - Shared vs dedicated energy/currency buckets
  - Event rewards and conversion pressure
- Participation design:
  - Minimum viable board requirement
  - Entry barriers and completion pacing
- Anti-friction and anti-abuse:
  - Anti-spam controls for repeat participation
  - Event reset and reward decay rules
- Required outputs:
  - Event template block for implementation
  - Example 7-day event playbook
  - KPI mapping (entry rate, completion rate, event ARPDAU impact)

## Next Data to Capture
- Final event ladder structure and recommended durations
- Recommended rarity schedule for event rewards
- Event economy conversion points and pacing recommendations
