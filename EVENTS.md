## Executive Snapshot
Track 3 confirms that the highest-performing merge games run on a **layered cadence model**: recurring long events plus short high-intensity bursts, with strong anti-fatigue controls and eligibility gating.

## Event Cadence Recommendation

- **Major Festivals:** 72-hour anchored window, typically Fri-Mon.
- **Midweek Progression:** 48-hour window.
- **Micro-Bursts:** 60–180 minute daily/weekly pulses.
- **Seasonal layers:** optional 30–60 day arcs for collection and long memory.

## Trigger Strategy

### Anchor Triggers
- Use recurring calendar anchors for prediction and habit formation.
- Rotate rewards and rules across events to reduce fatigue.
- Keep one strong weekly rhythm and one short interruptive pulse.

### State/Retention Triggers
- Unlock complex events by progression milestones (for example level-based gates).
- Use separate event energy/pools so events do not cannibalize core progression flow.
- Add completion streak/energy readiness reminders tied to meaningful game state.

## Anti-Fatigue and Fairness Controls

- Cooldown after high-intensity windows to reduce burnout.
- Cap concurrent boosters and stack effects.
- Segment late events by player maturity; do not force early players into high-commitment windows.
- Preserve optionality: players should be able to ignore a side-board event without UI pressure.

## Recommended MVP Parameters

- Set clear event entry tiers by player stage (D1-7, mid, veteran).
- Increase drops or output multipliers only within event windows and only for defined categories.
- Add reward floors that avoid trivializing baseline progression.

## Practical Event Framework

- Event board and core board should have distinct rules where possible.
- Event-specific economy should be mostly isolated from the main loop.
- Introduce predictable weekly windows with transparent timers.
- Keep event UI focused: objective, next checkpoint, and clear end time.
