# Track 4 — Retention and Session Design

## Run Metadata

## Executive Snapshot
The completed retention playbook recommends designing for short, frequent sessions (roughly 4–6 minutes) with clear return anchors. Early scarcity should stay light to preserve FTUE momentum, then progressively tighten in week 2+.

## High-Confidence Findings

### Core Session Parameters
- Design for frequent short sessions rather than marathon sessions.
- FTUE target: first meaningful action under 20 seconds to first merge.
- First-order completion should remain low friction.
- Keep board complexity manageable in the first 3 sessions.

### Onboarding Sequence
1. Session 1: immediate gratification and very low gate pressure.
2. Session 2: gentle economy introduction.
3. Session 3: introduce core loop commitments (daily reward, order queue).
4. Sessions 4–6: event board and contextual re-engagement prompts.

### Hook and Habit Loop
- Use clear parking state: players should always see a next step when energy is low.
- Prefer contextual push triggers over generic reminders.
- Add contextual permission strategy to request notifications after value is shown.
- Add a streak/return arc with mild forgiveness (e.g., streak-saver).

### Retention Benchmarks
- D1 target setpoint: approximately 30%+ in top-cohort planning range.
- D7 target: roughly 10%+ as the critical cliff.
- D28/D30 target: around 4–5% for top-tier casual monetization trajectories.

### Operational Instrumentation
Track these events: `session_start`, `session_end`, `first_merge_time`, `first_order_time`, `energy_spent`, `energy_gained`, `board_full`, `push_permission_prompt`, `push_permission_granted`.

## Session Design Blueprint
- Keep event energy loops separate so core progression and event rewards do not cannibalize each other.
- Use micro-quests to fit short sessions.
- Provide end-of-session anchors with explicit return timers.

## Risks to Avoid
- Early over-scarcity in the first 24 hours.
- Hard board clog without intervention tools.
- Generic push messaging disconnected from game state.
